## More than one thing could be interpreted as a curse. This page is about the cursed items in specific.

A cursed item is an item that will always reappear when removed by anyone, therefore not needing a lock. The curse will not override owner locks. Items are verified in a similar way than how one would apply them. Therefore, a cursed item will not appear when it has been blacklisted, if the zone is blocked, prerequisites are not met, etc. The curse can now be used with any items. See below for the list of groups. Should the curse be in a fail state, please report it to prevent the issue. The system overall is much smoother than it used to and should be more intuitive

**The curse should trigger a fail state if it detects something anormal is happening.**

**Note: see cursereport commands for details about your current activated curses**

You can curse any item with the **#name curseitem [group]** command. The group name is one of the ones given in the list down below. Each slot has a corresponding name and is self-explanatory. Most, if not all, should be intuitive. For example, cursing a necklace is simply **#name curseitem necklace** 

Owners and the club owner have access to more zones than mistresses. Make sure you have the appropriate permission level.

It will save the currently applied color to your list of color, therefore, the color of your cursed item will remain. Should you want to change the color while keeping it cursed, you can do so and use the **savecolors** function available for the wearer or mistresses/owners.

Owners also have the **clearcurses** command available to quickly remove every curses on the wearer.

Note: You can also have an empty curse. This means, you can curse a slot to remain empty. It is by design.
