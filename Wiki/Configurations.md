## Many options are available to customize the curse to your lacking. See the functions page for the exact command names. Here is what can be done:

* Normal vs Intense mode (More albeit more controlling features)
* Activated only when mistresses/owners are there, only when they are not there or at all times
* Disabling auto punishments
* Choosing the color of the punishment restraints
* Saving the currently applied colors so that curse items will respect your color code
* Making all messages silent (Do not disturb mode)
* Changing the character and name to be called by (ie: #ace to !bunny)
* Forwarding all whispers sent to others to the wearer
* Disabling the wearer from adding mistresses/owners
* Toggling whether or not items should vanish when a curse is lifted
* Toggling whether or not valid commands should be displayed to the wearer
* Toggling the display of wearers (the "C")
* Toggling blindfolds to always fully blind the wearer

**Note: see configreport/cursereport commands for details about your configs**
