## Many speech restrictions can be given to the wearer, some require the intense version as they are quite intrusive.

**NOTE: starting in 1.1.3 and over, messages containing transgressions will not be sent, there is the isclassic function to revert back to the old system**

* Muting: will be punished when trying to say something
* Complete mute (will not be able to send ANY normal chat message)
* Sound: This forces the wearer to say a given sound. Any pattern for as long as the letters are in order. Therefore if your sound is "Meow" this is a valid message: "Me..ow? meeeow! mmeooowwwwwww?! meow. me.. oo..w ~"
* Banning words: first person and begging are presets to make it simpler, the whole list can be cleared permanently or turned off temporarily. Singular words can be added. The whole list can be turned off without deleting it with #name speech command. It is turned on and empty by default.
* Forcing a name to be said with miss/mistress in front
* Giving an entry message. This is a message that must be said when entering a room. As long as it is the first message sent, no matter when that is, it works.
* Making someone say something: "Say" will force the wearer to send a message "willingly"
* Sending on the wearer's behalf: "Forcedsay" will send the message as the wearer automatically.
* Banning use of contractions like "I'll, she'll, won't".
* Restrained speech: the wearer is unable to speak freely, she is given a set of sentences/targets allowed and can only use those with the *#name talk* command. The given sentences can contain the %target% placeholder to have the target inserted into the sentence. The given sentences can contain the %self% placeholder which will be replaced by the given "self" attribute. By default it is "I", but could be changed to something else to avoid having to rewrite all the sentences. WARNING: a target id and a message id always needs to be specified. Therefore, you will be softlocked/muted if this mode is enabled and you remove all sentences and/or targets.
* Doll talk: limit words to 6 letters and messages to 5 words maximum.
* Gagged OOC: this prevents the wearer from being able to use "(" while gag to cheat out of a gag 

**NOTE: speech restrictions do not apply to OOC**
**Note: see the speechreport command for details about your current speech restrictions**
