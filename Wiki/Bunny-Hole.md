I've decided to invite those courageous enough to wear the curse into my bunny hole. You can find the invitation in the main hall.

In there, you can find information, toggle intense mode, wear the curse for the first time or even ask for some examples of what can be done!

Careful though, if I put a curse on you, you'll have to find someone to turn things around.

The bunny hole features the curse info page. Next to the exit button, you will notice the settings menu. This UI shows you your current status for **most** curses. I've tried to feature as much as I could in there, but some specific curses remain only viewable through chat commands. This aims to give new users a better view of what's achievable.
