// These are the default texts when the tag is missing in the translated language
// If a tag is modified, it will bear "V2" after it and it will be required for translator to verify its counter part in their language
// %PLAYER% is a placeholder, it will be replaced by the player's name. "The curse on %PLAYER%" becomes "The curse on ace", for example.
// {0}, {1}... are placeholders where the extra text based on variables will be inserted. You can place that text where it fits in your own language.
